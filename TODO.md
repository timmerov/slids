## Compiler

- **Forbid shadowing type names with variable names**: Using a class name as a variable name should be a compile error. `String String = "..."` is currently not caught and causes ambiguities and vexing parses — the parser cannot tell whether `String` in expression position refers to the type or the variable. Builtin type keywords (`int`, `float32`, etc.) are already safe since they are reserved tokens; user-defined class names are identifiers and need an explicit check.
